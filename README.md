This repository contains the course materials for a first year "Computational Data Analysis I" course.

## Updating the documents for a new semester

1. The script pages have a footer indicating the semester year and the lecturer(s)' name(s) 
    - this can be changed in the `header.yaml` within the script folder
2. Within most of the scripts and the exercise solutions working directories are set 
    - these need to be changed accordingly

## makefiles

The script, exercise and solution folder contain a makefile for quick and easy rendering of all rmds within their respective folders.
