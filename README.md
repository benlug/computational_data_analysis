The course details methods for summarizing, visualizing, and analyzing data through linear models and explores both continuous and discrete probability distributions, emphasizing practical applications in statistics.

## Teaching

## Updating the Documents for a New Semester

1. **Footer Updates**:
   - The script pages have a footer indicating the semester year and the lecturer(s)' name(s). This can be changed in the `header.yaml` file within the script folder.

2. **Directory Paths**:
   - Most scripts and solution files have predefined working directories. These paths may need to be updated to reflect the current environment setup.

## Makefiles

The script, exercise and solution folder contain a makefile for quick and easy rendering of all rmds within their respective folders.
